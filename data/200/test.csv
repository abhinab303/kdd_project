Tick And Bite Recognition API,"Tick And Bite Recognition API - TickBitor (also known as tick bite detection API) is a cross browsers REST API which get a JSON input with a still photo (as base64 encoded string) or an url of the image and returns a JSON string which contains predictions with certain amount of probability (filtered for output with minimum 20%), bounding boxes of detected tick and / or bite(s) of tick with its top, left, width, height values and, if required, for each prediction, a boundingBoxPhoto as base64 encoded string of the detected ticks or bites or both. Also it outputs a base64 encoded string photo which is the original input photo with drawned bounding boxes upon it. For one still photo the API may return multiple predictions with different probability scores of detected ticks and / or bites. Our pricing packages count the predictions, so for one request, multiple predictions may be counted. We filter the results of predictions so we display only the predictions with a probability score higher than 20%. Of course, there are some limitations in order to get a higher accuracy. We recommend properly exposed, unobstructed JPEG photos at 1920x1080 (full HD resolution) where target ticks and / or bites may fill an important space in the input photo as you see in the example below. We do not store pictures. Also, the quality and the angles of the camera are very important and it contribute to a higher detecting accuracy. It should have varifocal lenses, high shutter speed, good infrared lighting beam, full HD resolution.
Allthough this Ticks And Bites Detection API (currently we do not offer a face tick and bite recognition sdk) is intended for software development and therefore developers, we have also here an tick and bite detector online application that may be used to check the input and output JSONs of the API.",Medical
